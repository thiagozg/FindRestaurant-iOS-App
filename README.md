**Attention: for build project, it's necessary to replace `keys.yelpApiKey` on `YelpApi.swift` for a [valid key](https://www.yelp.com/developers),**
**You can keep the implementation, if you generate this key using [Cocoapods Key](https://www.lordcodes.com/posts/managing-secrets-within-an-ios-app).**
